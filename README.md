# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)



In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  
The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: By analyzing the data from multiple NYC agency sources, our shiny application can demonstrate the impact of Covid-19 on people's daily life at New York city. Our applications reveals a large shift of people's life including living style, people's financial status, living condition and vaccine distribution since the explosion of Covid-19 virus.
+ In our application, we divided our data exploration into 3 categories, including 311 service request [link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9), homeless shelters and hospitals. These aspects are all highly related to people's daily life and therefore we can analyze these data to help us better understand influence of Covid 19. These will help us know how to better improve people's living standard given this major life change.
